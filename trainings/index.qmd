CoastWatch regularly organizes and offers in-person and online satellite training classes or workshops featuring lectures, tutorials, & tool demonstrations.

During in-person and online satellite course, participants learn about environmental satellite data and how to easily obtain it. Participants also gain hands on experience working with the data of interest to them. A major goal of the course is to provide scientists who are not regular users of satellite data with the knowledge and tools they need to incorporate satellite data into their research and management projects.
