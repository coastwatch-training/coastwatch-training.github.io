## Course Description
This 4-day satellite and ocean data training course will be held virtually during February 10-13 (FJT), 2026. It is co-hosted by CoastWatch/OceanWatch Central Pacific and the [Pacific Islands Ocean Observing System](https://www.pacioos.org/) (PacIOOS).

## Learning Outcomes
* Learn where to find satellite, remote sensing, and ocean parameter data
* Become familiar with the ERDDAP platform to visualize, subset, and download data
* Learn to judge which products are appropriate for your application or who to contact to get guidance
* Apply what you learn on a personal project so that you leave the course with ready-to-use workflows

## Course Logistics
This course will be conducted entirely online. Anyone is free to sign up for the course, although it is targeted at participants in the Pacific Islands region, and the live sessions are scheduled to align with their workday. At the start of each day (9:00 am FJT, 11:00 am HST), there will be a live session where we will preview the material participants should go over that day, discuss the previous day’s material, and answer any questions. Each day, there will be a live Q&A session (2:00-3:00 pm FJT, 4:00-5:00 pm HST) to answer any questions regarding the materials, exercises, or the project you are working on.

Participants should expect to spend about 1-2 hours/day in live sessions and at least 2-3 hours/day working on their own, going through the course material at their own pace, and working on their project. All of the course materials are available online, and participants will go through them at their own pace, but there is a suggested list of modules to cover for each day of the course. Instructors will be available during the week to help or answer questions. The last day will be a 2-3 hour student presentation day (see below).

## Project
As part of the course, participants are expected to come with a specific project to work on during the class. Participants get more out of the workshop if they have specific questions or projects to work on. Everyone will give a short (1 slide, 2-minute MAX) lightning talk during the last class session. The project can be as simple as making a map or a time series for the region of interest, for those who are new to working with satellite data, or as complex as a participant feels comfortable with. Any ancillary data needed for projects should be available on hand.

## Course Structure
The Day 1 live session will include an introduction to the course and the instructors. This will be an opportunity for participants to introduce themselves and briefly describe their class project. On Days 2 and 3, during the live session, the instructors will review the previous day’s homework, preview the course activities for the self-study periods, and answer any questions that have come up. Guest lectures and tools demos may also be included. Participants work at their own schedule and pace to complete the course content and work on their individual projects. The first few days feature video tutorials on satellite data, example software tutorials, and homework exercises. As the class progresses, participants will use the self-study period to work on their individual projects.
