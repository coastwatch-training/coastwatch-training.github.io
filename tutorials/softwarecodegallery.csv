ERDDAP Basics - Using the ERDDAP data catalog,"Learn how to navigate the ERDDAP data catalog to discover datasets of interest. This tutorial walks through browsing available datasets, using full-text search to refine results, and examining dataset summaries and metadata to evaluate spatial coverage, resolution, time range, and data provenance.",ERDDAP-Basics/using-the-erddap-data-catalog,ERDDAP-Basics/using-the-erddap-data-catalog/using-the-erddap-data-catalog.qmd,tutorials/ERDDAP-Basics/using-the-erddap-data-catalog/using-the-erddap-data-catalog.md,erddap-data-catalog.png::Global SST & Sea Ice Analysis (OSTIA) dataset from the UK Met Office on an ERDDAP server.,erddap
ERDDAP Basics - Visualize and download data,"This tutorial demonstrates how to use ERDDAP’s Make A Graph feature to visualize gridded data, subset by time and region, customize map appearance, and download results in common image and data formats. Users learn how to generate reproducible URLs for sharing or importing data directly into analysis tools such as Python, R, or Matlab.",ERDDAP-Basics/visualize-and-download-data,ERDDAP-Basics/visualize-and-download-data/visualize-and-download-data.qmd,tutorials/ERDDAP-Basics/visualize-and-download-data.md,"vis-erddap-data2.png::The ERDDAP Make A Graph page for the OSTIA global sea surface temperature dataset. The interface allows users to select the displayed variable, subset data by time, latitude, and longitude, adjust graph and color-bar settings, choose output file formats, and generate reproducible RESTful URLs for visualization and data download. | vis-erddap-data3.png::Sea surface temperature map for the Washington coast on July 15, 2015, generated using ERDDAP’s Make A Graph tool.

ERDDAP Basics - Understanding the ERDDAP URL,"This tutorial explains how ERDDAP data requests are fully defined within a URL and how those URLs can be edited to control dataset selection, spatial and temporal subsetting, output formats, and visualization settings. You will learn how to modify URL components by hand to retrieve different maps, images, and data files, including accessing the most recent available data. The tutorial concludes by showing how ERDDAP URLs can be generated and used within scripts to automate data downloads and integrate ERDDAP directly into analysis workflows.",ERDDAP-Basics/understanding-erddap-url,ERDDAP-Basics/understanding-erddap-url/understanding-erddap-url.qmd,ERDDAP-Basics/understanding-erddap-url/understanding-erddap-url.md,"erddap-url1.png::Sea surface temperature map for the Washington coast generated by directly editing an ERDDAP request URL.
