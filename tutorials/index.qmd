title: "Training Tutorials"
---

The CoastWatch tutorial collection is organized to support users working with satellite data at different stages of their workflow. Tutorials are grouped into two broad categories: **software-focused tutorials** and **coding-based tutorials**.


## Software Tutorials

Software tutorials provide guidance on installing, configuring, and using commonly supported tools for working with CoastWatch satellite data. These tutorials focus on foundational software and utilities that are often used to access, explore, or manage data prior to analysis.

Topics include:

- ERDDAP access and configuration  
- CoastWatch utilities  
- Working with NetCDF files  
- Using data visualization tools such as Panoply

## Coding Tutorials

Coding tutorials demonstrate how to access, subset, analyze, and visualize CoastWatch satellite data using common programming languages. These tutorials are organized by **exercise or topic**, and many are available in multiple **software languages** such as Python, R, and MATLAB.

The Code Gallery provides an overview of available coding tutorials and direct links to each language-specific implementation.

## Educational use
All tutorials are provided for educational and demonstrative purposes. Code examples are intended to illustrate workflows and techniques and should be reviewed, tested, and adapted as needed before being used for research or operational applications.
