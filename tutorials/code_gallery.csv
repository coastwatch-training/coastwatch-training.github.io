This tutorial demonstrates how to locate and subset a satellite SST product in ERDDAP, download gridded NetCDF data, examine its structure, and create basic spatial maps and regional time series. Users work with the NOAA Coral Reef Watch CoralTemp monthly sea surface temperature product to explore coordinate conventions, generate SST maps, compute regional averages, and visualize temporal variability.",tut1_1_py.png::Time series of sea surface temperature in the western North Atlantic Ocean along the US East Coast in 2022. | tut1_2_py.png::Map of the 2022 average sea surface temperature in the western North Atlantic Ocean along the US East Coast.,tut1_1_r.png::Time series of sea surface temperature in the western North Atlantic Ocean along the US East Coast in 2022. | tut1_2_r.png::Map of the 2022 average sea surface temperature in the western North Atlantic Ocean along the US East Coast.,tut1_1_m.png::Time series of sea surface temperature around the Hawaiian Islands in 2018. | tut1_2_m.png::Map of the 2018 average sea surface temperature in the Hawaiian Islands.
