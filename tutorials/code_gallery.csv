It walks through downloading sea ice concentration data from PolarWatch ERDDAP, inspecting CRS definitions, applying EPSG-based coordinate transformations, and adding the transformed coordinates back into a NetCDF dataset.","transformproj1.png::Monthly mean sea ice concentration for December 2022 from the NOAA/NSIDC Climate Data Record, displayed using transformed latitude–longitude coordinates on a global (Plate Carrée) map projection. | transformproj2.png::The same December 2022 sea ice concentration data visualized on a Southern Hemisphere polar stereographic projection.","transformproj1_r.png::Monthly mean sea ice concentration for December 2022 from the NOAA/NSIDC Climate Data Record, displayed using transformed latitude–longitude coordinates on a global (Plate Carrée) map projection. | transformproj2_r.png::The same December 2022 sea ice concentration data visualized on a Southern Hemisphere polar stereographic projection, illustrating the improved representation of Antarctic sea ice when using a projection optimized for polar regions.",
