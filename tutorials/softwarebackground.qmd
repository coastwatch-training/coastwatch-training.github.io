## ERDDAP basics: What is ERDDAP? {#erddap}

For many users, obtaining the ocean satellite data they need requires downloading data from several data providers, each with its own file formats, download protocols, subset abilities, and preview abilities.

**A short list of ocean satellite data providers:**

- Jet Propulsion Laboratory (PO.DAAC)
- NASA Ocean Biology (OB.DAAC)
- NASA Goddard Space Flight Center
- NOAA Center for Satellite Applications and Research
- NOAA CoastWatch Central Operations
- NOAA Office of Satellite and Product Operations
- NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI)
- NOAA Comprehensive Large Array-data Stewardship System (CLASS)
- European Space Agency (ESA)
- Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA)

The goal behind ERDDAP is to make it easier for you to get scientific data. To accomplish that goal, ERDDAP acts as a middleman, selectively channeling datasets from remote and local data sources to a single data portal. With ERDDAP as the single-source portal, you have access to a simple, consistent way to download subsets of gridded and tabular scientific datasets in common file formats, with options and make graphs and maps.

*Features of ERDDAP:*

- Data in the common file format of your choice. ERDDAP offers all data as .html table, ESRI .asc and .csv, Google Earth .kml, OPeNDAP binary, .mat, .nc, ODV .txt, .csv, .tsv, .json, and .xhtml
- ERDDAP can also return a .png or .pdf image with a customized graph or map
- Standardized dates/times ("seconds since 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z" in UTC)
- A graphical interface for humans with browsers
- RESTful web services for machine-to-machine data exchange and downloading data directly into your software applications (e.g.Matlab, R, Python...) and even into web pages.

## NetCDF files {#netcdf}

**NetCDF (Network Common Data Form)** is a file format for storing multidimensional scientific data (variables), including common satellite observations (e.g., sea surface temperature, salinity, chlorophyll, winds). Many organizations and scientific groups in different countries have adopted netCDF as a standard way to represent some forms of scientific data.

The NetCDF format has many advantages, the most important of which is that it is self-describing, meaning that software packages can directly read the data and determine its structure, the variable names and essential metadata such as the units. This self-describing aspect of the netCDF file format means that the information needed to ensure accurate work (reduce the incidence of errors) is available within the data itself (no need for additional files). Secondly, it means that different analysis software, like Matlab, R, Python or ArcGIS (among many others), have utilities to read and work with NetCDF files. Thirdly, plotting software (e.g. Ferret, Panoply, ncview) can directly read the netCDF files for visualization.

## NASA Panoply {#panoply}

NASA developed the Panoply viewer that allows users to view and visualize data held in NetCDF files. Some features the software includes are:

- Visualize data from netCDF and HDF files
- View the metadata
- View the data
- Display the data in many different map projections
- Download visualization as images
- Create animations
- Freeware

![](images/panoply1.png){width=60%}

Panoply is available for download at: https://www.giss.nasa.gov/tools/panoply/ and can be run on Windows, Mac and Linux computers.

A set of "how to" instructions can be found to the following URL https://www.giss.nasa.gov/tools/panoply/help/
Below are a few examples to try out to get you used to visualizing data with the Panoply Viewer.

💡 **Panoply Version Note:** The examples provided in CoastWatch materials are based on Panoply **Version 5.3.3** (interfaces may differ slightly across versions).


## CoastWatch Utilities {#cwutils}

The **CoastWatch Utilities** (CWUtils) are software tools designed to help users work with NOAA/NESDIS CoastWatch satellite data—especially because these scientific data files aren’t meant to be opened in standard image viewers.

### What CoastWatch Utilities includes

CWUtils provides both:
- Graphical tools for interactive exploration
- Command-line tools for scripting and repeatable processing workflows

The tools commonly support workflows like:
- Information and statistics (inspect file contents, compute summary stats)
- Data processing (format conversions, compositing, variable math, sampling)
- Graphics and visualization (interactive visualization + batch rendering)
- Registration and navigation (resampling between projections; navigation correction)

### Getting CoastWatch Utilities

CWUtils is available for **Windows, macOS, and Linux**.
The [User’s Guide notes](https://github.com/coastwatch-training/CoastWatch-Utilities/blob/main/downloads/cwutils_ug_4_0_0.pdf) (minimum recommendations): **~400 MB disk** (1 GB recommended total workspace) and **4 GB RAM**.

To download, the guide directs users to the CoastWatch site and to look for **CoastWatch Utilities** under Data Tools (or search “utilities”).

### CoastWatch Utilities Online Course
The [CoastWatch Utilities Online Course](http://coastwatch-training.github.io/CoastWatch-Utilities/) is about using the CoastWatch Utilities software package to help with processing satellite imagery and derived data products. The course covers working with data files (i) visually using a graphical user interface, and (ii) by typing commands at the Unix or Windows command prompts. No programming experience is needed, though it can be helpful when automating data processing.
